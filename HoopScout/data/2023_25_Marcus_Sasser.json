    "Report": {
        "Strength": "Sasser is a 6’2 PG/SG with solid length (6’7 wingspan) and quickness on the perimeter; along with above average footwork, body control and agility … His perimeter J is his bread and butter offensively, where he shot 37% on a robust 7 3-point attempts per game for his career … Has NBA range, a smooth release & follow through, and unabashed confidence … Very comfortable taking deep shots pulling off the dribble going left or right, and is also a really consistent threat spotting up in rhythm with space … Shows wiggle and space creation skill and likes to utilize step-back jumpers…Had 11 games with 4+ made 3-point shots as a Sr, illustrating his ability to score in bunches with his jumper…Effective utilizing runners when chased off the line; a necessity for players who lack size … Career 82 FT% (85 FT% as a Sr on a career-high 4.2 FTA/G); won’t make many mistakes from the stripe late in games … Takes care of the ball and limits live ball turnovers (1.4 topg for his career) … Can operate in pick and roll offense adequately enough to not look out of place chipping in as a secondary playmaker; uses pace dribbles and the threat of his jumper to create passing lanes for occasional dump-offs to bigs … Decent transition player who can be used as a shooting valve off ball or occasionally applying pressure calling his own number getting downhill … Competitive defensive player who has the length and lateral quickness to cut off penetration, stagnate offensive possessions and force turnovers (1.6 spg) … Among the best point of attack perimeter defenders in the 2023 Draft class, but also shows solid awareness navigating through screens and can disrupt passing lanes off the ball…May see his efficiency rise at the pro level with less shot-creation responsibilities ",
        "Weakness": "Average athleticism as he lacks much in the way of explosiveness and leaping skills … Below average physical profile outside of his relatively long arms, not being particularly impressive with his height, strength or frame … Shoots a ton of jumpers and has a tendency to settle and take ill-advised, closely contested shots … Doesn’t get to the rim very often in half-court offense and struggles to convert amongst the trees in the paint once he gets there due to a lack of elevation … Much more wired to score than facilitate; doesn’t show great playmaking instincts and usually prefers to use screens to get space for his own shots … Handled the ball a ton in college and doesn’t project to see nearly as many possessions for himself at the NBA level … Doesn’t break down the defense often enough in isolation to justify extended on-ball responsibilities, and had possessions when he pounded the ball too much when he should’ve swung it to his teammates … Middling efficiency (around 44 FG% his final 2 college seasons, career 40 FG%) and can be a bit streaky with his shot … Some durability concerns after missing parts of 2 seasons dealing with toe and groin injuries",
        "Outlook": "Projects as a valuable two-way guard who can contribute as a defensive stopper and floor spacer off the bench.",
