    "Report": {
        "Strength": "One of the premier shooters in college basketball as a freshman at 43% on over three attempts per game … Efficient from beyond the arc both in spot-ups and off the dribble … Fluid shooting motion with a textbook high release … Excellent frame at 6’7 with a wingspan just over 6’10 … Filled out body at 217 pounds with a powerful lower half … Solid first step and flexible hip movement allow him to create remarkable space for himself before even putting the ball on the floor …  Complements this movement with a polished step back jumper that he can bury from both inside and outside the 3-point arc … Intelligent cutter from the corner and wing … Uses long strides and terrific body control to attack the basket and slither around contact … Switchable, active defender who has the length and athleticism to guard multiple positions … Not only has the length to disrupt action as a defender, but also possesses the instincts and quickness to read and jump passing lanes as an off-ball defender … Active hands as an on-ball defender who can frustrate ball-handlers trying to move across his body … Decent free throw shooter at just under 80% … Assist numbers were low, but the flashes of accurate passing and court vision are certainly there … One of the youngest players in the draft turning 19 on August 1st …",
        "Weakness": "Despite coming in as one of the top recruits in the nation, Whitehead struggled to carve out a role for himself … Athleticism never looked right, was a step slow and unable to explode, most likely due to a foot injury that was lingering all season … Was most affected with his inability to get any lift when leaping and it had a clear effect on his ability to dunk and rebound … Grew more comfortable over time, but his inside-the-arc shot creation never flourished with the Blue Devils … A 41% shooting percentage from 2-point range supports that … Negative AST/TO ratio with 27 assists to 39 turnovers … Needs to be more aggressive offensively. Attempted only 28 free throws in 28 games for the Blue Devils as a freshman … Also needs to show more aggression on the glass with just 2.4 rebounds per game … A fractured foot in the pre-season certainly played a large role, and his in-game leaping ability became a major hindrance at Duke … He had a second foot surgery after the season that has made it impossible for him to work out for teams, so his feasibility as a first round pick is likely something organizations will have to discuss with their team doctors in order to figure out …",
        "Outlook": "With such a premium put on shooting in today’s NBA, it makes Whitehead an obvious gamble in the late first round that he can rehabilitate his foot injury and regain the explosiveness that made him one of the top 5 prospects nationally in his class for most of his high school career … If Whitehead is unable to regain some of his pre-college explosiveness, it’s unlikely he will be able to have a productive pro career",
