        "Strength": "Henderson is a 6’2 190 guard with outstanding length (wingspan reported to be around 6’9) and a strong build already as a 19 year old … He also possesses standout athleticism, as he has top-notch speed, agility, body control and explosive leaping ability off one or both feet … Aggressive; has very little problems getting where he wants to on the court, even when turning the corner against ball hedges or traps, and does a great job of pressuring the defense with his burst and speed but also decelerating and/or stopping on a dime to keep defenders off balance … Absorbs contact and is rarely knocked off his pivot when slashing to the rim … Can also finish at the rim over and through defenders in emphatic fashion due to his strength and leaping skills … Likes to operate at the point of attack to create offense for himself and his teammates, and is most comfortable with the ball in his hands … Very tricky player to stay in front of due to the slithery footwork, great 1st step and outstanding ball-handling skills that he displays … More patient than your typical explosive, speed demon type PG his age; willing to let plays and passing lanes develop to make well-timed feeds to open teammates if the defense is tilted too much his way … Good mid-range scorer going in either direction but especially to his right; with all kinds of smooth dribbling ability to subtly drift and navigate laterally to open space for shots if he can’t get downhill … Good shot mechanics give some optimism that he can extend his shooting range in the future; shows a decent follow-through and always looks balanced when rising into his jumper … Strings together hesitation and inside-out moves masterfully, weaving inside and around the defense to get space for his pull-up jumpers and floaters in the lane … Also can convert with either hand around the rim, where he shows strong creativity in avoiding shot-blockers and getting shots on the rim/backboard with good touch … Not a bad option to have the ball in his hands late in the shot clock … Will be a major handful in both transition and pick-and-roll offense with his ability to collapse the paint and score near the hoop & 15-18 ft area (16.5 ppg in 22-23 season), but defenders must also be mindful of his strong playmaking skills on the move that allows him to hit open teammates for easy shots often as well (6.8 apg) … Prefers to score but just about as effective as a passer and generally shows a really solid basketball IQ for a young prospect with his on-court decision making (2:1 A:TO) … Mix of length, athleticism and energy on the defensive end are encouraging; tools are there for him to at least be a threat to force turnovers or recover from mistakes effectively as he gains more experience (1.1 spg, 11 blocks in 19 games last season) … Willing rebounder from the lead guard spot who can initiate on the go after missed shots, applying pressure before the defense can get set (5.3 rpg) … Has flair to his game and will be a highlight waiting to happen, especially with the types of dunks/finishes he can pull off … Never seemed to run from the idea of being a main face on his teams after elevating to the G-League early out of HS, which is encouraging as someone who will potentially be seen as a franchise-changing player in the pros  …",
        "Weakness": "3-point shot needs improvement (27 3FG%); added range and consistency would make him an even more dangerous matchup problem offensively … Currently more comfortable taking lower percentage shots off the dribble than open with his feet set (42 FG%) … Will inevitably be dared to shoot deep shots and has to prove that he has to be guarded in the screen game to keep defenses honest, which will have an impact on spacing given how often he operates in those types of actions … Dictates the pace well, but sometimes spends too much time pounding the rock which can stagnate the offensive flow … Natural feel for being a playmaker for others can stand to improve; sometimes takes ill-advised shots before looking to set up the offense … Given the pressure he puts on the defense, his lack of trips to the charity stripe in the G-League was disappointing (2.9 FTA/G, on 76.4%) … A work in progress defensively, not yet being consistent on a possession-by-possession basis … Got washed out of ball screen action too easily at times last season, needs to improve his ability to navigate switches … Doesn’t deny dribble penetration as effectively as someone with his tools should currently, and also doesn’t use his length to contest or offer resistance when guarding taller players enough either … Coaches will also want to work on his fundamentals and understanding of principles on that end, and he was often late to rotate or out of position when off the ball, which led to too many open shots this past season …",
        "Outlook": "Scoot Henderson has been a heralded name in the amateur circuit as early as winter 2019 when he was lighting up the scoreboard at Kell HS in the Atlanta area as a Soph … He went on to have an even more prolific run of scoring as a Jr., averaging 32 ppg, before bypassing his Sr. season to play professionally with the NBA G-League Ignite in 2021, where he became the leagues youngest player ever at 17 years old … During his rookie year in the G-League program, he had good production (14 ppg, 4 rpg & 4 apg) on a team that featured eventual 2022 Draft picks like Dyson Daniels, Jaden Hardy and Marjon Beauchamp … He upped his stats in nearly every category in Year 2 with the team and showed off his elite athleticism and ability to take over games as a scorer and facilitator … He will definitely need to work on his 3-point shot and correct some of his flaws on defense, but the groundwork is there for him to take a step forward in both areas…His shot isn’t broken from a form or touch standpoint, and he already is effective in the mid-range … Defensively he has all the physical tools (except average height) to improve defensively as long as he gains experience and works on his attention to detail and fundamentals…If he can get his 3-ball to around league average territory, watch out … Scoot Henderson with the threat of making 3s has the potential to be arguably the best PG prospect in quite some time that could revolutionize the position over the next decade, similarly to Derrick Rose & Russell Westbrook 15 years ago … Even if he never quite becomes consistent with it he will be a high floor prospect who can provide flamboyant highlights and instant outstanding offensive production with his ability to pressure the defense … Look for Henderson to be a top 3 pick, with him having a very good chance of hearing his name at #2 to Charlotte after the Victor Wembanyama to San Antonio pick …",
