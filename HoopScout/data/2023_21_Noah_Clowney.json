        "Strength": "Clowney is a sleek and mobile 6’10 210 C/PF who fits the mold of what teams look for in modern day bigs/frontcourt guys and has the frame to add significant mass … Runs the floor well and shows pretty solid leaping skills with a head of steam, making him a promising transition player on both ends of the court … Very rangy and long (reportedly has a 7’2 wingspan); can cover massive ground on the move and is a hard player to get shots over which makes him a promising frontcourt defensive player … Good timing as a shot-blocker (0.9 BPG), particularly as a help defender; can get his hands on shots at the highest point … Has the tools to switch and guard on the perimeter as he gains experience, and showed nice flashes of ability to be disruptive with his length against smaller players as a Fr … Has some of the best numbers in this draft class as a finisher in close, and is a player who can convert above the rim or with some finesse (67 FG% inside the arc) … Good hands & reflexes to grab both rebounds (8 RPG) and errant passes outside of his area … Solid on the offensive glass … Likes to face-up and has soft touch & 3-point range on his shot, with the potential to be a solid producer as a spot-up threat in time (34 made 3s as a Fr.) … Feel for the game is ahead of your typical raw bigman prospect; generally doesn’t force action or try to play outside of his role/strengths … Hustles and is a willing cutter who gets rewarded with alley-oops and dumpoffs … Likes to set screens and get himself shots by rolling to the rim or popping out for jumpers, making him a player who can feed off teammates and chip in as a scorer without having to create for himself directly (9.8 PPG) … Form on his shot give his scoring and shooting a lot of intrigue, despite unimpressive efficiency … May just be scratching the surface of the talent he possesses; more of a late blooming, diamond in the rough type who could grow into an important player with more experience … A ‘young’ Fr. who will just be turning 19 years old shortly after the 2023 Draft",
        "Weakness": "Needs to fill out his frame and improve his base strength and toughness; got knocked backwards when met with contact often at the college level by bigs and some wings, which doesn’t bode well taking a step up in competition … Sometimes can be overly reliant on his length to bail himself out defensively, and can be neutralized when slashers get into his chest/body which leads to fouls (2.5 FPG) … More of a linear run-jump athlete than a lateral mover due to his high center of gravity; really needs to work on sinking his hips and sliding his feet consistently … Bit of a ‘tweener’ big at the moment; could struggle with quickness switching in space on the perimeter and from some NBA PFs but also may struggle with the physicality of some NBA Cs … A face-up frontcourt guy but doesn’t show much handling the ball or creating offense … Haven’t seen him show much as a post scorer either; won’t have many plays drawn up for him … Shot looks solid fundamentally, but the efficiency is still improving as of now (28.3 3FG% on 3.3 3FGA/G) … Doesn’t pass the ball much (0.8 APG) … Drew fouls at an OK rate but needs improvement converting at the line once he gets there (65 FT% on 3.1 FTA/G) … Pretty green, not yet the sum of his parts",
