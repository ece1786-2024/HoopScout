    "Report": {
        "Strength": "A physically gifted PG/SG who stands a legitimate 6’7 200 lbs with the frame to add muscle easily … A smooth athlete who has solid body control & leaping ability, and will likely improve his explosiveness with time in an NBA teams training program..Is most comfortable acting as a playmaker for his teammates offensively (4 apg as a Fr.); plays unselfishly, is more steady than flashy, and has promising floor vision as you’d expect from a taller lead guard … Likes to play in the pick and roll game, and was especially good at finding shooters and cutters when some of Arkansas’ main contributors were healthy earlier in the season … Lulls defenders and changes pace pretty well off the bounce to open slashing lanes for himself … Generally accurate making passes on the move and finding streaking players in transition … Isn’t bad when he calls his own number in transition either; gains a head of steam and can convert above the rim in the open floor … Uses his size well when looking to finish plays at the rim against smaller guards, should only get better with more strength (50.3 FG% inside the arc) … Has been an excellent defensive player this season and will be able to defend PG-SF as a pro eventually as he gains experience … Possesses very quick hands and anticipation to swipe and create turnovers (1.9 spg), but also smothers slashers with his length and active feet, forcing difficult shots … Rebounds nicely from the perimeter (5.3 rpg) and looks to get transition opportunities quickly with hit-ahead passes after getting boards and steals … Above average on the offensive glass for a guard prospect as well (1.3 orpg); seemingly has gotten a 2nd chance basket every game as a Fr … Seems to be more comfortable in command of the offense, but has shown that he can play off-ball and flashes the awareness necessary to cut to open spots for shots near the rim … Has the skill set of someone who will potentially be a triple double threat, competes with good energy and contributes in multiple ways when on the court",
        "Weakness": "Some question his toughness and leadership as he didn’t put up a big fight when Nick Smith got healthy and seemed to defer the team over to Smith … More smooth than explosive; not especially quick and doesn’t always separate from defenders off the dribble…Not a natural scorer and lacks some polish to his floor game operating in the half court…Currently struggles a bit as a shooter (30 3FG% on 2.8 attempts a game); gets little elevation on his shot and his follow through doesn’t hold up well when asked to make jumpers off the dribble, leading to some bad misses…Minimal mid-range game…Would do him wonders to work on consistently making open jumpers, as defenders will sag off him and dive his screens until he proves to be more of a threat…As of now, Black is tied for the most totals turnovers in the SEC (3.2 topg)…For as unselfish as he is, Black too often drives the lane with pre-determined reads in mind and will force passes even if the defense has him walled off…Needs to work on not telegraphing where he wants to go with the ball; also is prone to leaving his feet when passing the ball…Some of his inefficient passing can be attributed to the lack of spacing that Arkansas has offensively due to reluctant, albeit poor team 3-point shooting that allows defenses to overload inside the arc, but his decision making as a passer can certainly improve…Plays with a higher center of gravity and can at times be susceptible to having the ball swiped away from him when slashing to the rim…Can contribute in a number of ways offensively, but doesn’t quite stand out at anything currently … Maturity? There are some attitude concerns which likely will be flushed out by lottery teams in the interview process …",
