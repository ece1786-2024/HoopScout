        "Strength": "Smith Jr is a 6’5 185 lb combo guard prospect with very good length and nice athleticism for the NBA level … Really quick and speedy, and has the frame to add muscle … Likes to score the ball (12.5 ppg as a Fr.) and is pretty aggressive doing so, especially when it comes to slashing or hitting shots off the dribble … Can put up points in chunks at his best (5 20 point games in 17 games played) and is widely viewed as a ‘microwave’ scoring threat … Won’t have many problems breaking down the defense; has a combination of good ball-handling ability and a quick 1st step that gives him intriguing potential as a shot creator … Comfortable in the mid-range; can pressure defenders with his ability to stop on a dime and stick pull-up jumpers … Makes good use of runners and floaters in the lane as well … Occasionally makes some flashy lay-ins at the rim with his craftiness and touch … Not afraid to shoot from long range either, and showed some flashes from distance this season (1.4 made 3s game on over 4 attempts) … Can play on or off the ball and generally did a nice job of being active as a cutter or looking for ways to get open for shots when he was on the wing … Has all the tools to be an effective defender in the backcourt, and played with good energy in a demanding defensive system at Arkansas … Has strong on-ball defensive potential, but also has enough quickness and length to deflect passes and become more of a threat as a ball thief … Would fit well in an up-tempo offensive system with his speed and aggressive approach; has good projections as a open court player",
        "Weakness": "Not very physical and a bit light in the britches at the moment; needs to add more muscle to his frame … Can get steamrolled on the ball as a defender more than you’d like to see and really struggled as a finisher offensively (39.6 FG% inside the arc) … Shot selection needs improvement (37.6 FG%); often takes low percentage shots in the mid-range area when he would be better served moving the ball or attacking the rim … Pretty inconsistent 3-point shooter (33.8 3FG%), doesn’t handle contests that well right now and will often change his release with a hand in his face … Listed as a combo guard, but isn’t a natural playmaker for others (1.7 apg) … When he’s on ball he mostly only passes as a last resort after the defense collapses on him … Middling feel for the game and basketball IQ at this stage, will force action and try to make plays that aren’t there … Doesn’t have much impact on games outside of scoring; can be hard to justify playing him when his shots aren’t falling … Won’t contribute much on the glass and is a poor rebounder even for a backcourt player (1.6 rpg) … Pressed on but never quite gained his rhythm after missing a critical chunk of the season dealing with a knee injury",
        "Outlook": "Incoming Arkansas freshman … 2022 McDonald’s All-American … MVP of the 2022 Jordan Brand Classic with 27 points (7-15 FG, 5-7 3PT, 8-8 FT) … Scored 10 points in the 2022 Nike Hoop Summit … 2022 Naismith High School Player of the Year Finalist",
