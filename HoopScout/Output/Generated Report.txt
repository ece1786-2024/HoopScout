**Strengths**:
Cameron Hayes stands out as a proficient shooting guard, thanks to his exceptional three-point shooting, evidenced by an impressive 45.6% from beyond the arc. At 6'4" with a 6'5" wingspan,
he brings a solid build and good size to his position. Hayes is a versatile scorer, demonstrated by his 14.8 points per game on 47.2% shooting from the field, and maintains an efficient playstyle with an effective
field goal percentage of 61.5%. His ball-handling skills and vision are noteworthy, with 3.2 assists per game, allowing him to create opportunities for team play. Additionally, Hayes shows potential on the defensive end with
1.8 steals per game, reflecting his instincts and ability to disrupt passing lanes. Known for solid free throw shooting at 80.4%, Hayes excels in pressure situations at the line.

**Weaknesses**:
Despite his offensive prowess, Hayes sometimes exhibits inconsistency in focus, attributed to his lack of effort in practice settings. This lack of intensity may limit his ability to translate talent into continuous growth.
Defensively, while his steal numbers are commendable, Hayes averages only 0.3 blocks per game, indicating limitations in rim protection. On offense, his 2.8 turnovers per game suggest a need to refine decision-making
under pressure and reduce errors. Furthermore, improving his off-the-dribble shooting and capacity to finish through contact would greatly enhance his overall impact and ensure he can withstand more physical NBA defenses.

**Outlook**:
Hayes possesses considerable potential, primarily due to his shooting capabilities and scoring instincts. His trajectory will largely depend on the consistency of his work ethic and dedication to improvement.
Should he address these challenges, Hayes has the potential to be a valuable rotational player or an off-the-bench scorer who can shift the momentum in games with his shooting. His skill set is well-suited for the modern NBA,
where perimeter play and spacing are critical.

**Player Comparison**:
Cameron Hayes' playing style and ability to shoot efficiently from deep draws parallels to J.J. Redick. Like Redick, Hayes is primarily a shooter who can leverage his scoring ability to carve out a
significant role in rotations, provided he commits to consistent effort and development.
