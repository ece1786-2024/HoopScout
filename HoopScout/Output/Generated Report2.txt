**Strengths:**

Kobe Henderson is a dynamic 6'2" point guard with a unique blend of size, length, and court vision. His 6'9" wingspan gives him an advantage in both defensive and offensive scenarios,
allowing him to disrupt passing lanes effectively (1.1 SPG) and secure rebounds unusually well for a guard (5.4 RPG). Henderson's game is characterized by his impressive playmaking ability — evidenced by his 6.5 APG — and 
his knack for finding open teammates, showcasing a high basketball IQ and a comprehensive understanding of the game. His time with the NBA G League Ignite has honed his professionalism and aptitude
against higher competition, refining his skills further. Henderson's scoring comes from his ability to create off the dribble and his capability to build offense in transition.
His competitive spirit and commitment to team success are highlighted by his desire to take on leadership roles and make those around him better.

**Weaknesses:**

Despite his talents and considerable tools, Henderson has areas to address. His shooting efficiency needs work, with a three-point percentage of 27.5%, indicating a requirement for improvement in his perimeter
game to become a more consistent scoring threat from long-range. Additionally, his overall shooting touch can be unreliable, with a 42.9% field goal percentage. His ball security is another concern, as highlighted by his 3.5
turnovers per game. Henderson could benefit from refining his decision-making under pressure and curbing unnecessary risks. Adding consistency to his shot mechanics and working on his explosiveness in half-court settings
could enhance his offensive versatility.

**Outlook:**

Kobe Henderson projects as a high-upside asset with potential to evolve into a starting point guard in the NBA. His G League experience provides him with an edge in terms of understanding professional
play styles and adjusting to the physicality and speed of the NBA. If he can refine his shooting and decision-making under pressure, Henderson has the chance to move beyond a floor general to a primary scoring option.
Teams seeking playmaking, length at the guard position, and defensive intensity will find significant value in Henderson.

**Player Comparison:**

Kobe Henderson's playstyle shares similarities with Lonzo Ball. Like Ball, Henderson brings strong playmaking, rebounding for his position, and defensive versatility, balanced with room for growth in shooting accuracy and scoring
in high-pressure situations.
